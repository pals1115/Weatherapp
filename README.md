*DESCRIPTION*: The Weather Dashboard is a fully responsive, dynamic web application that enables users to retrieve real-time weather information and a 5-day forecast by simply entering the name of a city. Built using ReactJS, Axios, and the OpenWeatherMap API, this project demonstrates a practical use of API integration in frontend development while showcasing modern UI design, dynamic styling, and user-centric error handling.

This project was created as part of a hands-on learning module in ReactJS. The goal was to develop an interactive application that fetches external data and updates the UI dynamically based on the data received. In this case, weather information is retrieved from OpenWeatherMap's public API, processed, and visually represented in a clean, user-friendly format.

🚀 Project Objectives
The core aim of this project was to:

Understand the basics of API integration with React

Learn how to manage and update state using useState and handle asynchronous data fetching with async/await

Implement conditional rendering based on user input and API responses

Create responsive layouts and stylings using plain CSS

Display both current and future weather data in a visually engaging way

🔧 Key Features
🔍 City-based Search: Users can type any valid city name to retrieve current weather conditions.

⛅ Real-Time Weather Info: The application fetches current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and condition.

📅 5-Day Forecast: Displays the weather forecast at daily intervals using filtered API data.

🎨 Dynamic Backgrounds: The UI dynamically changes background gradients based on weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy, snowy, etc.).

❌ Error Handling: If the user enters an invalid or unrecognized city, a friendly error message is displayed.

💻 Responsive Design: Works across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
